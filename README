ThinkPad Fan Control daemon (tpfand)
====================================

tpfand controls the system fan of ThinkPad notebooks based on specified 
temperature profiles. Seperate trigger points can be configured for every
temperature sensor in the notebook.

tpfand is written entirely in Python and licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.

REQUIREMENTS
============
Python 2.5
DBus with bindings for Python
thinkpad_acpi kernel module with fan control support

NOTE: Some versions of the thinkpad_acpi module must be loaded
	  with fan_control=1 to enable fan control. On some distributions
	  you have to append the line "thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1" to
	  /etc/modules. Refer to your distribution manual about
	  kernel module configuration.

INSTALLATION
============
1. Adjust src/tpfand/build.py to your needs.
2. Run make install
3. Make sure that tpfand is started on every boot. This is done
   in a distribution specific way. (for example with update-rc.d
   on Ubuntu)
4. Install the man page tpfand.8 (optional)
5. Download contributed profiles from 
   http://www.gambitchess.org/tp-fan/profile_download.py
   and extract them to the directory you specified under data_dir in build.py. 
   (optional)

You can uninstall this program by running make uninstall.

CONFIGURATION
=============
The configuration file is /etc/tpfand.conf.
After manual changes to this configuration file tpfand must
be restarted.

tpfan-admin, a GTK+ configuration tool, is also available and the
recommended way of configuring tpfand.
